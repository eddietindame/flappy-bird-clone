# flappy-bird-clone
Interactive project built in Processing [URL](https://processing.org/).

Graphically appealing Flappy Bird clone which can be played with the mouse or using an Arduino board attached with ultra sonic sensor.

Not an example of well written (by my standards) or modular code but was more of an expression of creativity as my first videogame project.

The interactivity was fun to implement - although clicking the mouse is more accurate than waving your hand.

This (among other assignments) got me 100% in my Creativity in Interactive and Tangible Media module :-)
